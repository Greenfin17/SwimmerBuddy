Workout App for Swimmers

This app will allow swimming enthusiasts to save their workouts and organize and search them by emphasis, distance, stroke, date submitted or author. The user will then have a ready collection of workouts to choose from when planning their training. The user can create new workouts and select the format, yards or meters, and the pool configuration, short course or long course, for a new workout. The user will be presented with a variable length form for adding sets. The user can enter the time interval for each set and the number of repetitions. There will be a field for describing each set as well as each portion of the set, i.e, kick/swim/drill by 25’s, build, descend each round, etc. The user will be able to update and delete any workouts they create. The user will be able to mark their workouts as shared or public so that others may view their workout.

I need an easy to use application to save workouts from my swim club, so that I can pull them out for when I swim on my own.  I often end up doing exactly the same workout that I have memorized. An app would facilitate planning my own training, and could be useful for other swimmers.
